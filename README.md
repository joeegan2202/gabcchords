# GABCChords

A Java program to interpret Gregorian Chant scores in the gabc format and convert to Lilypond scores.

Planned Features:
* Provide easy interface to input chords for organ accompaniment.

This project goes along with [nova-organi-harmonia](github.com/joeegan2202/nova-organi-harmonia). I needed a tool to make transcribing scores easier than [ahinkley's](github.com/ahinkley) gabc-to-csv-to-ly pipeline.
